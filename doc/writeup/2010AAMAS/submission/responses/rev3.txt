Regarding skepticism as to whether this is appropriate for a real
world approach, we agree that further work is needed before that could
be claimed. The current work attempts to carefully understand the
issues in a simplified setting, so that eventually these can be
incorporated into an approach which will include a variety of aspects to
address practical real world learning.
Although the assumptions and limitations are too strong for real world
applications, we do not consider that relaxing these will invalidate
the core findings. The simplifications make it easier to study the
particular structural issues that are of concern.
