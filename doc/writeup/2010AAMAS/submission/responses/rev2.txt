We would appreciate references to work mentioned that allows agents to
learn a plan is not suitable in a certain state.  Assumptions of no
change in environment is a simplification to allow exploration of
issues regarding the BDI structure. The agent must eventually learn in
an environment that does change, but it should notice changes and
learn outcomes accordingly. Automated failure handling was also
excluded in order to more fully understand structural issues affecting
learning. It would be incorporated in a practical system, and is part
of ongoing work.  Stability is important only for failure, not
success. All (failing) plans must be stable before propagating
failure.  Difference between ACL and BUL is RecordFailedTrace routine
which is applied to BUL whereas ACL simply records all results.
