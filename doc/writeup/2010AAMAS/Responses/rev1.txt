The aim here is not (yet) to provide the final algorithm for a
practical BDI learning system, but to explore carefully the
issues that need to inform such an algorithm.
The graphs in figures 4 and 5 both use non-deterministic actions. Only
graph 6 uses deterministic actions and an applicability
threshold. Figure 5 is actually the new algorithm superimposed on
Figure 4b.
The reason for presenting initial approach as well as improvement is
because the aim here is to fully understand the issues.
In a final system the learning is expected to complement rather than
replace context conditions, and to use a limited set of fluents for
any given goal (based on either developer information or automated
calculation of fluents used).
