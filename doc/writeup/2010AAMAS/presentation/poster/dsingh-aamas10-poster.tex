%%%%% Introduction
\begin{textblock}{4.6}(0.2,4)
\posterheading{Summary}
We address the \alert{plan selection problem} in Belief, Desire, Intentions (BDI) Ag\-ent Systems.

%An important drawback in BDI is the lack of a learning ability. 
\alert{Context conditions} of plans determine
applicability in given situations, and must be specified

upfront. However, new environments often require learning changes to selection conditions.


Easing this constraint would allow conditions to be \alert{refined} once deployed, improving adaptability. 

Our learning framework augments plan's context conditions with \alert{decision trees}, allowing \alert{plan applicability} to be learnt from experience.

Using a \alert{probabilistic plan selection} function, the agent balances exploration and exploitation of plans, while learning online.

%%%%% BDI Plan Library

\posterheading{BDI Architecture}

A \alert{plan} is a rule of the form $e: \psi \leftarrow \delta$; program $\delta$ is a strategy for goal $e$ when context $\psi$ holds.

The burden for the programmer is to perfectly design the logical formula $\psi$.

Plans perform primitive actions or post sub-goals that are handled in a \alert{hierarchical} manner.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The imposed BDI hierarchy implies that high level plans may fail not because they were poor choices for the situation but due to poor choices further below. 
\item Learning is performed \alert{online} while acting in the environment, so care must be taken in how much \alert{confidence} to put in each decision tree on an ongoing basis.

\end{enumerate}

%%%%% BDI Learning Framework
\begin{textblock}{4.6}(5.2,14)
\posterheading{BDI Learning Framework}

Each plan's logical formula context condition is augmented with a \alert{decision tree}.

A \alert{probabilistic plan selection function} balances exploitation of ongoing decision tree learning and further exploration of the state space.

\alert{Acting and learning are interleaved}. Ongoing learning impacts the choice of future actions that impact subsequent learning and whether a good solution is eventually found.

%%% Experimentation
\begin{textblock}{4.6}(10.2,4)
\posterheading{Experimentation}

%We experiment with a range of \alert{synthetic hierarchies} to see how each learning approach is impacted by the goal-plan structure. We look at two aspects of learning.

We study the impact of goal-plan structures on learning performance. We use \alert{synthetic hierarchies} that model some features of real BDI programs.

\alert{How to record training set}: We compare two approaches, a conservative one (BUL) that only records failures when all plan choices are considered well-informed, and an aggressive one (ACL) that records all outcomes.

\alert{How to use decision trees}: A confidence measure is applied to the decision tree prediction to calculate plan selection weights. Confidence is related to the \alert{coverage} of paths below a plan.
