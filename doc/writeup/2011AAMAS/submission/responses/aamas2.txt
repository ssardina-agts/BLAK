Issues identified - ordered according to importance to address:

the paper lacks a comparative evaluation against other common learning
algorithms from the literature (beyond the "BDI learning" approach).
The performance of the method could be compared to any general
learning method from the literature (learning which (applicable) plan
should be selected in a state).

There should also be some discussion on how the plan selection process
fits into the BDI architecture (e.g. when an execution trace fails,
dropping goals, etc),

Response:
The BDI execution process itself is not changed. The standard plan
selection process is simply replaced by the decision tree and
probabilistic selection. Once failure recovery has occurred in a
particular execution trace, no further data is collected for the
learning from that trace (unless the failed execution made no changes).

importance and sensitivity of the parameters, e.g. \alpha

Additional measures regarding the reliability of the results, e.g.
statistical variance, should be provided to indicate the significance
of the results.
it is unclear how significant and reliable these results are.

formal definition of 'stable(P,w)' and 'mathcal{P}(P,w)' should be
included (both in section 3).
