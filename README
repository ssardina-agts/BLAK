1. ABOUT

This package contains the source files for the BDI-Learning work being undertaken within the Intelligent Systems Group at RMIT University.
For more information on this package contact Dhirendra Singh (dhirendra.singh@rmit.edu.au).
This file is for the internal use of the BLAK developers.


==================================
2. BUILD 

2.1 LATEST SOURCES

Download the latest sources from the svn repository:
> svn co svn+ssh://USERNAME@goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/research/ai/linpa/RepositoryRoots/Software/BDILEARNING/SVNROOT bdilearning

2.2 DEPENDENCIES

Apart from the sources included in this package you require the following tools:

2.2.1 Java SE Development Kit (JDK 6 or later) 
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp.
You probably have a recent version of the JDK already installed. If not download the JDK for your platform and follow the installation instructions. Make sure that the installation is in your PATH. Verify by typing:
>java -version
>javac -version

2.2.2 Ant Java-based Build Tool Verion 1.7.0 or later. 
http://ant.apache.org/.
Download ANT and follow the package installation instructions. Make sure that the installation is in your PATH. Verify by typing
>ant -version

2.2.3 Weka Data Mining Software Version 3.6.0 or later. NOTE that 3.7.x will not work due to API changes.
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka.
Download the latest stable version of WEKA for generic platforms. Unzip the zip file and copy weka.jar to location ./lib/weka.jar in this package.


==================================
3. COMPILING

Compiling the code is straighforward. From the top level directory (one that contains build.xml) do the following:
>ant release
This will run the target in build.xml that builds everything as follows:
./build/classes/* : Contains all the generated JACK files and all built class files.
./build/dist/*    : Contains the distribution tree 
./build/blak.zip  : Archive of the above distribution tree for release to end users.


==================================
4. RUNNING TESTS

Instructions for running the tests are located in the README file that comes with the release package blak.zip. TO get started, copy the archive into a fresh directory and unzip the contents. This creates a top level directory called ./blak. Locate ./blak/README and follow the instructions provided.
