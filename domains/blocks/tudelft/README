In the GoalAgents folder you find different agents.
The agents used for the experiment were deliveryAgent (in GOALAgent dir), and blocksworld (see the mas files in BlocksWorld subdir of GOALAgent dir).

The project is an eclipse project, you should be able to open it.
If not, please let me know.

The learning is hooked into the Goal engine (goal.core package).
The learning algorithm itself is in the edu.liacs.dlt package.
However, you should be able to use any model-based RL learner, and I also advice you to do so, and not use my own implementation , as this is one with quite some overhead in it (it's a dumbed-down version of a more complicate RL model I worked on).

The main idea is explained in the paper, if you have any questions, please mail.

Best,
Joost.
