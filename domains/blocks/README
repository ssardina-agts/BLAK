Blocks World Domain 

This is a JACK program that learns to solve problems in the Blocks World domain using our BDI Learning framework[1,2,3,4]. The aim is to first duplicate the efforts of Broekens et al.[5] that learns rule selection using reinforcement learning in the GOAL agent language, and eventually integrate their ideas into our framework.
