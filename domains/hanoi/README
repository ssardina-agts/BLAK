This example is the well known Towers of Hanoi puzzle.

The puzzle consists of 9 different size discs with holes
sitting on 3 pins. The discs are numbered from 1 to 9
from largest to smallest. The initial ordering is
established in the "init.dat" file; disc 0 is an imaginary
disc representing the table (or an empty pin).

          |                     |                     |
7      ===|===        8       ==|==         9        =|=
4   ======|======     5    =====|=====      6     ====|====
1=========|=========  2 ========|========   3  =======|=======

The objective is to move all the discs across to the rightmost
pin using the other pins as needed. The discs must end up on
the rightmost pin in order with the largest disc on the bottom.
The player must move only one disc at a time and it can only
be moved on to an empty pin or on to a larger disc. Thus, a
larger disc can never be placed on a smaller disc.
